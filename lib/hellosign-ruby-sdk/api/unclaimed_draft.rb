    module UnclaimedDraft

      #
      # Creates a new Draft that can be claimed using the claim URL.
      # The first authenticated user to access the URL will claim the Draft and will be shown either the "Sign and send" or the "Request signature" page with the Draft loaded.
      # Subsequent access to the claim URL will result in a 404.
      # If the type is "send_document" then only the file parameter is required.
      # If the type is "request_signature", then the identities of the signers and optionally
      # the location of signing elements on the page are also required.
      # @option opts [Integer] test_mode (0) Whether this is a test, the signature request will not be legally binding if set to 1.
      # @option opts [Array<String>] files Use files to indicate the uploaded file(s) to send for signature. Currently we only support use of either the files parameter or file_urls parameter, not both.
      # @option opts [Array<String>] file_urls Use file_urls to have HelloSign download the file(s) to send for signature. Currently we only support use of either the files parameter or file_urls parameter, not both.
      # @option opts [String] type The type of unclaimed draft to create. Use "send_document" to create a claimable file, and "request_signature" for a claimable signature request. If the type is "request_signature" then signers name and email_address are not optional.
      # @option opts [String] subject The subject in the email that will be sent to the signers.
      # @option opts [String] message The custom message in the email that will be sent to the signers.
      # @option opts [String] signing_redirect_url The URL you want the signer redirected to after they successfully sign.
      #
      # @option opts [Array<Hash>] signers List of signers, each item is a Hash with these keys:
      #   * :name (String) Sender' name
      #   * :email_address (String) Sender's email address
      #   * :order (Integer) The order the signer is required to sign in
      #   * :pin (Integer) The 4-digit code that will secure this signer's signature page. You must have a business plan to use this feature.
      # @option opts [Array<String>] cc_email_addresses The email addresses that should be CCed.
      # @option opts [String] form_fields_per_document
